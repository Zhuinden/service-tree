# Change log

-Service Tree 1.0.1 (2017-03-02)
--------------------------------
- `getBoundServices()` should return a `List<Entry`, because `List<Object>` containing services without their keys is essentially useless.

-Service Tree 1.0.0 (2017-03-02)
--------------------------------
- Initial release.

The library is so simple though that it goes to 1.0.0 directly.
